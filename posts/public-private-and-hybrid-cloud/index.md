## Introduction {#introduction}

Public Cloud
: delivered via the internet and shared across organizations

Private Cloud
: dedicated solely to your organization

Hybrid Cloud
: any environment that uses both public and private clouds


## Public Cloud {#public-cloud}


### Service Features {#service-features}

-   Pros
    -   No investments required to deploy and maintain the IT infrastructure (cloud vendor's responsibility)
    -   High scalability and flexibility (to meet unpredictable workload demands)
    -   Flexible pricing options
-   Cons
    -   total cost of ownership (TCO) can rise exponentially for large scale usage
    -   lease secure
    -   low visibility and control into the infrastructure


### Vendor Responsibility {#vendor-responsibility}

responsible for developing, managing, and maintaining the pool of computing resources shared between multiple tenants from across the network.


## Private Cloud {#private-cloud}


### Service Features {#service-features}

-   Pros
    -   Dedicated and secure environments
    -   Customizable &amp; Flexible
    -   high performance
-   Cons
    -   high price for short-term use cases
    -   may not offer high scalability


### Vendor Responsibility {#vendor-responsibility}


## Hybrid Cloud {#hybrid-cloud}


### Service Features {#service-features}

-   Pros
    -   Flexible policy to deploy workloads on public or private infrastructure (based on security, performance and cost)
    -   scale with security (public cloud resources to accommodate occasional spikes)
    -   reliable (multiple data centers -- public and private)
    -   cost control (sensitive workloads on private clouds, regular workloads on public cloud)
-   Cons
    -   toggling between public and private (how to track, what's the cost)
    -   public cloud resource management (different locations and categories)
    -   complexity of managing an evolving mix of private and public cloud architecture
